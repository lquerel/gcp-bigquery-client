//! Aggregate metrics for classification/classifier models. For multi-class models, the metrics are either macro-averaged or micro-averaged. When macro-averaged, the metrics are calculated for each label and then an unweighted average is taken of those values. When micro-averaged, the metric is calculated globally by counting the total number of correctly predicted rows.
